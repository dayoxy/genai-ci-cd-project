# MLOps GenAI Deployment Project

## Overview
This project is designed to implement a Generative AI (GenAI) application with a full CI/CD pipeline using Docker, GitHub Actions, and Terraform. It leverages machine learning tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and various cloud-native technologies to provide a robust, scalable solution for deploying and managing GenAI models.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Docker**: To build and run containers. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container Docker applications.
- **Git**: To clone and version control the project repository.
- **Terraform** (optional): For provisioning infrastructure on cloud platforms.

Additionally, the project is built with the following technologies:

- **Python** (with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Node.js** (for Frontend applications)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Terraform** (for cloud provisioning)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database management)

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mlops-genai-deployment-project.git
   cd mlops-genai-deployment-project
Install Docker and Docker Compose if they are not already installed. Follow the installation guides on the official Docker website.

(Optional) Install Terraform if you need to provision cloud resources.

Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose build
Start the services:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up
This will start the app, database, and any other services defined in the docker-compose.yml.

Running the Project
Once everything is set up and running, you can access the application:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or the configured port).

You can interact with the app, monitor logs, and see the results of the GenAI models in action.

CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation. The configuration for GitHub Actions is stored in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml. The pipeline is triggered on push to the main branch and performs the following tasks:

Build: Builds the Docker images for the app.

Test: Runs unit tests to ensure the code is functioning correctly.

Deploy: Deploys the app to a cloud environment (if configured) or a local setup.

You can check the status of the pipeline in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.

Testing
To run the tests:

Ensure that your services are up and running (docker-compose up).

Run the tests with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
This will execute the tests defined in the tests/ folder and show results in the terminal.

Contributing
